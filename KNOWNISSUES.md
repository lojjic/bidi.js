## BidiCharacterTest Failures (2)

Two tests from the standard `BidiCharacterTest.txt` suite are currently failing after the implementation of Unicode code point handling (Issue #9).

These failures relate to edge cases in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX#9), specifically concerning the interaction between explicit directional formatting characters (LRE, RLE, PDF) and subsequent neutral/numeric characters, likely involving rules L1 and/or 5.2.

Attempts to fix these specific test cases by modifying the core algorithm resulted in regressions in other tests or required brittle, special-case handling. These failures have been accepted as a reasonable tradeoff for the significant improvement in handling multibyte characters throughout the library.
